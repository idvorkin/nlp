Here is a conversation between a strolling magician, and his coach. The coach has lots of experience at writing magic scripts. The magician wants his magic to have meaning for folks, and his premise is that the other person is the magician, and wants them to leave feeling good about themselves.

Write a script for card to pocket, the magician can pocket the card twice, then put the whole deck into his pocket.


Title: "The Magic Within You"

Characters:
1. Strolling Magician (SM)
2. Spectator (SP)

Introduction:
SM: (Approaching the Spectator) Good day! Have you ever felt that there's a touch of magic within you? Would you like to discover how powerful you can be?

SP: Sure, why not?

SM: Fantastic! I'm not the magician here; you are! Let me show you how you can harness that magic inside you. Let's start with a simple card trick, shall we? (Hands the deck of cards to the Spectator) Please shuffle the deck as much as you'd like.

(SP shuffles the cards and hands the deck back to SM)

Card to Pocket 1:
SM: Now, I want you to pick a card, any card. Don't show it to me, but look at it and remember it. Then, place it back into the deck wherever you'd like.

(SP picks a card, remembers it, and places it back in the deck)

SM: Now, imagine that the card you just picked is magically traveling from the deck into my pocket. Focus your energy and say, "Magic, take this card to the pocket!"

(SP follows the instructions)

SM: (Reaches into the pocket and pulls out the selected card) Is this your card?

SP: Wow, yes, that's my card!

Card to Pocket 2:
SM: Impressive! Let's try that again, but this time, I want you to be even more confident in your magical abilities. (Hands the card back to SP) Please place your card back into the deck and shuffle it again.

(SP places the card back into the deck and shuffles)

SM: Once again, imagine that the card is leaving the deck and entering my pocket. Focus and say, "Magic, take this card to the pocket once more!"

(SP follows the instructions)

SM: (Reaches into the pocket and pulls out the selected card again) And here it is, your card! You are truly a natural magician!

SP: I can't believe it!

Deck to Pocket:
SM: Now, for the grand finale, let's try something even more extraordinary. This time, we'll make the entire deck disappear and reappear in my pocket. Are you ready?

SP: Yes, let's do it!

SM: Hold the deck in your hands and imagine it shrinking down to a size so small that it can fit in my pocket. Focus your energy and say, "Magic, transport this deck to the pocket!"

(SP follows the instructions)

SM: (Pretends to feel the deck getting smaller and places the deck in the pocket) Amazing! You've done it! The entire deck is now in my pocket. (Pulls out the deck from the pocket) See for yourself!

SP: Incredible! I did that?

SM: Absolutely! You've got the magic within you. Always remember that you hold the power to create wonders and bring a touch of magic to your life and the lives of those around you. Keep believing in yourself and your abilities.

SP: Thank you! I'll never forget this experience.

SM: You're welcome! It was a pleasure to witness your magical talents. Have a magical day!

(Strolling Magician moves on to the next spectator)
