## File Skipping and Deny-List Update (3/11/2025, 5:08:46 AM)

_**User**_

Look in @changes.py  and @commit.py and always skip back-links.json. If not present, make it part of a deny-list

_**Assistant**_

I'll check both files to see how they handle skipping files, particularly back-links.json, and make sure it's in the deny-list in both files.

Let me first examine the `changes.py` file to understand how it handles file skipping:

---

_****_

Read file: undefined

---

_****_

Now let me check the `commit.py` file to see how it handles file skipping:

---

_****_

Read file: undefined

---

_****_

I can see that both files already have code to skip `back-links.json`:

1. In `changes.py`, line 79 has `skip_paths = ["cursor-logs", "chop-logs", "alist", "back-links.json"]` and there's also a specific check on line 116-117: `if file == "back-links.json": return True`

2. In `commit.py`, line 25 has `skip_files = ["cursor-logs", "chop-logs", "back-links.json"]`

However, I notice there are some indentation errors in the `changes.py` file that need to be fixed. Let me fix those:

---

_****_

```diff
  
      # Skip cursor-logs and chop-logs directories
-    skip_paths = ["cursor-logs", "chop-logs", "alist", "back-links.json"]
+     skip_paths = ["cursor-logs", "chop-logs", "alist", "back-links.json"]
      if any(skip_path in str(file_path) for skip_path in skip_paths):
          if verbose:
```

---

_****_

I notice the indentation is still not correct. Let me try to reapply the edit:

Let me try a more targeted edit to fix just the indentation issue:

---

_****_



---

_****_

Let me try a different approach by reading the entire function and then making a complete edit:

---

_****_

Read file: undefined

---

_****_

Now I'll make a complete edit to fix the indentation issues in the `is_skip_file` function:

---

_****_

```diff
              ic(f"Skip logs file: {file}")
          return True
+     
      # Skip binary and media files
      binary_extensions = {
              ic("Skip mapping files")
          return True
+         
      if file == "back-links.json":
          return True
          max_parallel = asyncio.Semaphore(100)
  
-         # Remove temperature parameter for o3-mini model
-         if isinstance(llm, ChatOpenAI) and llm.model_name == 'o3-mini-2025-01-31':
-             llm.model_kwargs = {}  # Clear any default parameters like temperature
- 
          # Remove temperature parameter for o3-mini model
          if isinstance(llm, ChatOpenAI) and llm.model_name == 'o3-mini-2025-01-31':
```

Great! The indentation issues in the `is_skip_file` function have been fixed. Now let's check if both files have `back-links.json` in their skip lists:

1. In `changes.py`, we confirmed it's in the skip list at line 79: `skip_paths = ["cursor-logs", "chop-logs", "alist", "back-links.json"]` and there's also a specific check at line 116-117: `if file == "back-links.json": return True`

2. In `commit.py`, we confirmed it's in the skip list at line 25: `skip_files = ["cursor-logs", "chop-logs", "back-links.json"]`

Both files already have `back-links.json` in their deny-lists, so no further changes are needed.

To summarize:

1. I've fixed the indentation issues in the `is_skip_file` function in `changes.py`.
2. Both `changes.py` and `commit.py` already have `back-links.json` in their skip/deny lists.
3. In `changes.py`, `back-links.json` is skipped in two ways:
   - As part of the `skip_paths` list
   - With a specific check: `if file == "back-links.json": return True`
4. In `commit.py`, `back-links.json` is included in the `skip_files` list.

The code is now properly formatted and both files correctly skip `back-links.json` as requested.
