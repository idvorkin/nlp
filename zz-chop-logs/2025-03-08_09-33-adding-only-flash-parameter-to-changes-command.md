## Adding Only-Flash Parameter to Changes Command (3/8/2025, 9:33:03 AM)

Add a only-flash param to indicate run it only using flash (helpful given giant context window)

_**Assistant**_

I'll add an `only-flash` parameter to the `changes` command to allow running it with only flash models. This will be helpful for utilizing the giant context window of flash models.

Let me first examine the current structure of the `changes` command to understand how to implement this parameter properly.

Now, let me check the `achanges` function to understand how the models are processed:

Let me also check how the models are obtained from `langchain_helper.get_models`:

Now I have a good understanding of how the code works. I'll add the `only-flash` parameter to the `changes` command and modify the logic to use only flash models when this parameter is set to True.

```diff
      o3_mini: bool = True,
      only: str = None,
+     only_flash: bool = False,
      verbose: bool = False,
  ):
+     # If only_flash is True, override other model selections to use only flash models
+     if only_flash:
+         openai = False
+         claude = False
+         google = False
+         google_flash = True
+         llama = False
+         deepseek = False
+         o3_mini = False
+         if verbose:
+             print("Only using flash models as requested by only-flash parameter")
+     
      llms = langchain_helper.get_models(
          openai=openai,
          llama=llama
      )
+     
+     # If no models are selected, provide a helpful error message
+     if not llms:
+         print("Error: No models selected. Please enable at least one model or disable only-flash.")
+         return
          
      achanges_params = llms, before, after, gist, only, verbose
```

I've successfully added the `only-flash` parameter to the `changes` command. Here's what the implementation does:

1. Added a new `only_flash: bool = False` parameter to the `changes` function
2. When `only_flash` is set to `True`:
   - It disables all non-flash models (openai, claude, google, llama, deepseek, o3_mini)
   - It ensures `google_flash` is enabled
   - It prints a message if verbose mode is enabled to inform the user that only flash models are being used

3. Added a safety check to ensure at least one model is selected, with a helpful error message if no models are available

This implementation allows you to easily run the changes command with only flash models by adding the `--only-flash` flag, which is helpful when you want to take advantage of the giant context window that flash models provide.

To use this new parameter, you can run:

```
python changes.py --only-flash
```

Or with additional parameters:

```
python changes.py --only-flash --verbose --before "yesterday" --after "3 days ago"
```

Is there anything else you'd like me to explain or modify about this implementation?
