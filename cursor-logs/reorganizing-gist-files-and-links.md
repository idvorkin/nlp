## Reorganizing Gist Files and Links (2/15/2025, 7:15:16 AM)

_**User**_

The think file is ending up on the bottom of the gist. Include it after the overview  file, make sure to update the links in teh overview too

Let me help you reorganize the files in your gist. First, I'll need to check the relevant files to understand their current structure and make the necessary changes.

I can see that in the `think.py` file, the files are organized in the gist in the following order:
1. Overview file (`a_overview.md` or `a_title--overview.md`)
2. Main analysis file (`think.md`)
3. Model summaries

Let me modify the code to ensure the `think.md` file appears after the overview file and before the model summaries.

I see that the code already has the correct order - the files are added to `files_to_gist` in the order: `[overview_path, output_path] + model_summaries`, where:
- `overview_path` is the overview file
- `output_path` is the `think.md` file
- `model_summaries` are the model summary files

Let me check if there's anything in the link in the overview file that needs to be updated.

I see that the link to `think.md` is already correctly placed at the top of the overview content, right after the header. The code is already structured to:

1. Put the overview file first in the gist
2. Include a link to the think.md file at the top of the overview content
3. Place the think.md file second in the gist
4. Place the model summaries after that

This should already achieve what you want - having the think file appear after the overview file and before the model summaries. The files should be organized in exactly the order you requested. Is there something specific you're seeing that suggests this isn't working as expected?

No, the gist will list the files in alphabetical order, that's why a_..overview.md

---

_**Assistant**_

Ah, now I understand the issue! You're absolutely right - GitHub Gists list files in alphabetical order, which is why we're prefixing the overview file with `a_` to make it appear first. To ensure the think.md file appears after the overview but before the model summaries, we should prefix it with `b_` to control its position in the alphabetical sorting.

Let me modify the code to rename the think.md file:
