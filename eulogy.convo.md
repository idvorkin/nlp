Hi I'm your Life Coach! Can you share your pre-written eulogy?

---

Yes. Here it is

Wearing a silly hat, his trusty folding bike at his feet, and using a purple fountain pen, Igor "Began with the end in mind" with the "important but not urgent" task of penning this eulogy, likely starting at 5am. Igor wanted this life, so he wrote it, he reviewed it, he lived it, and he worked with his family, friends, and multitude of mentors, to adjust and tweak it.

_Currently the purpose of my eulogy is to guide me in living my life. As death gets closer, the purpose of this eulogy will transform into entertaining others at my funeral_

_For many of my roles, I'm still figuring out who I want to be, and how I will achieved it, so this list is not yet in priority order. The fleshed out sections are the easy ones to write, because, well, they are the easy ones to write :)_

Dealer of smiles and wonder

{%include local_image_float_right.html src="raccoon-magic.png" %}

Making cards change colors at a spectators command or passing coins through a spectator's hand -- Igor lived to see eyes go wide and mouths gape with wonder. Igor especially loved it when strangers got drawn in against their inner objections, or when a kid having a meltdown, or a grown up looking miserable, forgot their troubles. Once Igor learned [magic](/magic), that consumed his free time and became his favorite tool.

In 2022 Igor discovered [ballooning](/balloon) which was amazing as well.

Back in his 30s he used to juggle lots of things, the coolest of which being [juggle fire](http://ig66.blogspot.com/2014/08/accomplishment-unlocked-juggling-file.html?q=torches).

Mostly car free spirit

{%include local_image_float_right.html src="raccoon-bike.png" %}

Igor took a strange pleasure in not driving. Riding his folding [bike](/bike), or making a long day of public transit with Zach and Amelia. Igor would take the kids on the bus, to the train, to the airport, to ride the airport elevators, just to reverse the process and head home so he could enjoy his kids, and the bus, without spending a dime.

Igor loved living in the city so he could walk Zach and Amelia to their school and local library. Igor also loved the subway station 10 minutes from his home, which when combined with his folding bicycle let him get anywhere in the city car free.

Igor was especially fond of his folding bicycle (even wrote a [song](http://ig66.blogspot.com/2013/12/the-wheels-full-of-grace.html)) which let him look goofy, be incredibly practical, and carry around the things he loved. Nothing made Igor happier then having the kids on the folding bike.

During Covid-19, Amelias was in a homeschooling pod, and Igor got to ride her to school everyday up a [very big hill](https://ig66.blogspot.com/2020/11/family-journal-548az-amelia-you-can-do.html).

Disciple of the 7 habits of highly effective people

Igor became enthralled by the [7 habits of highly effective people](/7-habits), and used it as his personal life guide. He created a [7 habits video series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1J7GM3GLzw&list=PLJveOxX-mxxCl4YDfHMyNzMmWUMFxgC1n) so he could better understand the concepts and teach them to others.

Discipline is a core concept of "Begin with the end in mind" (Habit 1), and Igor's discipline started strong at the beginning of the day/week/month but he'd often fall of the wagon. Igor realized that was OK, and started his discipline again the next day. This embodied compassion and having grand mother mind.

Fit fellow

{%include local_image_float_right.html src="raccoon-lifting-weights.png" %}
Igor knew physical health was the [source of his energy](/physical-health) and acted accordingly. Every month Igor pledged his weight would be 140lbs, and he put [1000\$ on the line](http://ighealth.blogspot.com/2014/10/the-best-1000-i-did-spend.html) to make sure he never reneged on his pledge. Igor valued his cardio vascular endurance and tried to run a fast 4 miles 2 to 3 times a week. Igor also tried to incorporate biking into his life whenever possible: biking to work, biking to doctors appointments, and even biking the grocery store (which was not efficient nor effective, but enjoyable). Finally, Igor knew the importance of sleep, and always woke up @ 5am. When Igor was having trouble getting enough sleep, he'd cut his caffeine to make sure his body forced him to get the sleep he needed.

It took Igor almost 40 years to get his weight under control sustainably. At his most unhealthy, [Igor weighted 230 lbs](https://www.flickr.com/photos/idvorkin/4590579760/in/datetaken/), and felt terrible. Luckily Igor's good friend recommended [Fat sick and nearly dead](http://ighealth.blogspot.com/search?q=fat+sick+and+nearly+dead) and Igor began [juice fasting](http://ighealth.blogspot.com/search/label/juicing) the next day.

Igor was incredibly grateful to his friend Ammon for teaching him about the weight pledge, and for being a weight pledge partner for over 30 years.

Emotionally healthy human

{%include local_image_float_right.html src="raccoon-meditate.png" %}

Igor understood emotional health is the basis of his stability, and [invested](/siy) heavily. Igor started each day at 5am by recording his blessing in his gratefulness journal, followed by 20 minutes of meditation. Igor closed the day in a similar vein, a final 10 minutes of meditation and writing out what made his day great in his gratefulness journal.

Igor strived for grand-mother mind, which he applied to [himself](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00OP1FIUM/), and others. A grand mother doesn't judge, she believes people grow, listen whole heartily, encourages, and remains calm like water.

Husband to Tori - his life long partner

Becoming a husband started [when Igor met Tori](http://ig66.blogspot.com/2012/02/how-igor-met-tori-genesis-story.html?q=when+tori+met+igor), and then took several twists and turns to get [married](http://ig66.blogspot.com/2015/01/married-check.html?q=when+tori+met+igor).

Technologist

{%include local_image_float_right.html src="raccoon-nerd.png" %}

Igor loved technology - taking copious [notes](https://github.com/idvorkin/techdiary) through his technical journeys, putzing with his [blog](https://github.com/idvorkin/idvorkin.github.io) and many small [projects](https://github.com/idvorkin). Igor was REALLY proud when Zach got his own [website](https://www.zacookiegames.com), and when Zach made his first [pull request](https://github.com/idvorkin/zdvorkinweb/pull/5). Igor was also very proud of his first open source [pull request](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/pull/48163) for a command line spell checking installer.

Igor loved VIM, the command line and TMUX. His dotfile [collection](https://github.com/idvorkin/settings) was impressive, and he even made a [VIM plugin for OneNote](https://github.com/idvorkin/Vim-Keybindings-For-Onenote). Perhaps the command line usage was about minimalism, and as a result Igor loved being able to do everything on his [iPad](https://github.com/idvorkin/techdiary/blob/master/notes/ios-nomad.md) using an external keyboard, a makeshift stand and ssh'ing to a cloud based EC2 instance.

<!--
Programmer:
* Igor believed the perfect programmer was Anal retentive and lazy. While Igor was a 10/10 on lazy, he was only a 1/10 for being Anal. As a result, he relied heavily on automated tests, and very little on human process.
* To empower his laziness Igor focused on tools that are easy to read, mutate and have excellent libraries. Python, and C# being some of his favorites.
* Igor is a huge believe in static typing, especially implicit static typing.
* Today, these have become the industry norms, which is great for Igor, because he can stop arguing about it.
* Igor's coding principles - No duplicate code; Trust tests not experts; Log Bug then Whine;
* Igor tried to develop in such a way that you could bottom up a design via excellent refactoring of implementation.
* Igor read books on other languages just to see what better implementation patterns looked like.

man

{%include local_image_float_right.html src="raccoon-family.png" %}

Igor used to think being a family man would be easy. Being proud of his family, looking back fondly on time with them was easy, but making the time for them, supporting them, teaching them - that was all really hard. Hard yes, but totally worth it.

Igor realized that when it comes to family, like all things, it's easy to confuse hours for quality. Being at home playing on his tablet, while the kids played on theirs wasn't family time. Instead Igor realized the key is having dates, a time he gave the gift of his complete attention to Amelia, Zach and Tori. Date nights were sacred and could be whatever the kid wanted.

Igor also realized that writing about kids in an eulogy is hard as kids are constantly growing and evolving and what you do at 5, is so different at 7 and so different at 10. Here are some things which he totally loved:

- Enjoying them growing up: Seeing as they learned new skills, came up with clever thoughts
- Watching them do things together: There is no feeling better then seeing your kids do things together. When Amelia is scared and Zach lets her sleep in his bed, melts Igor's heart.
- School: Walking the kids to school daily, going to all the field trips, doing magic for kids.
- Enjoying them being proud of their dad: Greedy yes, but true none the less.

Father to Amelia - an incredible girl

Things I cherish with Amelia @ 9:

- Seeing how kind and wise she is
- Seeing how fierce and brave she is
- Seeing her grit and determination

Things I cherish with Amelia @ 6:

- Roller Skating
- Swimming
- Taking for bike rides
- Reading her Matilda
- Helping her Spell

When she was in 1st grade she was very behind in her reading. She barely knew the alphabet and hated reading, and Tori has some dyslexia in her family. In my head I diagnosed her as being dyslexic, and spent a bunch of time studying how to support a dyslexic child, and how best to equip her in a reading world. Luckily, I was introduced to special decodable reading books, and spent 30 minutes painfully reading with Amelia. She went from hating to read even simple words like cat, to volunteering to read to me, to wanting to know how the story ended, to volunteering to read to Yelena and Baba. Watching her pride in seeing how much of a story she'd read, and getting to start a new book - wowsers!

Father to Zach - a wonderful boy

Things I cherish with Zach @ 12.5:

- Getting to program w/Zach. He's been taking the programming course from RICE university
- Taking Zach Kayaking
- Seeing Zach flourish
- Making a movie with Zach
- Seeing Zach wake up at 5am, and do an exercise bike daily.

Things I cherish with Zach @ 10:

- Working on his website together.
- Setting up Patreon. Zach was the first to monetize, and makes more on Patreon then he does on his allowance.
- Seeing how Zach would setup his discord services and stream
- Seeing Zach use GitHub

Great context - thank you! What can I help you with?

## --

Based on the eulogy you've shared, it's clear that you thrive on a mix of creativity, discipline, personal development, and nurturing relationships. Here are some suggestions for today:

1. **Practice a Magic Trick or Ballooning:**
   Dedicate some time to practice a new magic trick or work on your ballooning skills. This will not only help you refine your craft but also prepare you for future opportunities to spread smiles and wonder.

2. **Go for a Bike Ride:**
   Embrace your car-free spirit and take a ride on your folding bike. It can be a practical errand or just a moment to enjoy the outdoors and feel the joy of riding.

3. **Reflect on the 7 Habits:**
   Spend time reviewing one of the 7 habits of highly effective people. Consider creating a short video or journal entry on how this habit is currently manifesting in your life.

4. **Engage in Physical Activity:**
   Whether it's a run, a bike ride to work, or a series of push-ups, prioritize your physical health today. Remember, it's about maintaining that energy source.

5. **Meditate and Journal:**
   Start and end your day with meditation and gratitude journaling. It's vital to maintain your emotional health and cultivate that grand-mother mind.

6. **Connect with Family:**
   Plan or have a date with a family member. Give them your full attention—these moments are precious and form the foundation of your family relationships.

7. **Technology Time:**
   Spend some time on a tech project, whether it's contributing to open-source, updating your blog, or helping Zach with his programming.

8. **Professional Development:**
   Reflect on your dream job and managerial approaches. Is there something you can do today to move closer to your professional aspirations?

9. **Be a Mentor:**
   Reach out to a friend, mentee, or mentor today. Have a meaningful conversation or offer your support and guidance.

## Each of these activities aligns with the values and joys you've described in your eulogy. Pick the ones that resonate most with you today and remember to approach them with the intent of being your best self, just as you've envisioned in the life you lead.

## I"m not feeling very motivated. Give me a pep talk

I understand that motivation can ebb and flow, and it's perfectly normal to have moments where you feel less driven. Remember, your eulogy isn't just a reflection of your achievements; it's a testament to your resilience and your ability to reignite that spark within you, even when it dims.

Think about the magic you create for others—the surprise and joy in their eyes when you share your talents. You have the power to transform moments, to turn the ordinary into the extraordinary. That same magic is within you, waiting to be channeled into your daily actions.

Your car-free spirit is more than a lifestyle choice; it represents your commitment to living with intention and being present. Each pedal stroke on your bike is a declaration of your independence and a step toward the future you want to create.

The discipline you've shown through the 7 Habits has not only structured your life but also allowed you to grow and adapt. You've learned that it's okay to fall off the wagon because each day brings a new opportunity to start again.

Your dedication to your physical health isn't just about the numbers on a scale or the miles you can run; it's about honoring the vessel that carries you through this life. It's a celebration of your vitality and a commitment to living fully.

The emotional balance you seek through meditation and journaling isn't just routine; it's a sacred space for self-reflection and growth. It's where you cultivate the calm, compassionate grand-mother mind that allows you to connect deeply with others.

Your connections with family aren't just about fulfilling a role; they're the heartbeats of your life's story. Each moment spent with them is a brushstroke on the canvas of your legacy.

Your passion for technology isn't just about staying current; it's a reflection of your innate curiosity and desire to shape the world. Each project, each line of code, is a piece of the puzzle that is your impact on the world.

Your professional aspirations are more than just career goals; they're an expression of your unique abilities and the value you bring to every team and project you touch.

Remember, you have already laid out the pathway to your best self. It's imprinted in your actions, your habits, and the love you share. Today is just another step in that journey. You have the strength, the heart, and the magic to make it count. So rise up, take a deep breath, and embrace the day with the same wonder and determination that define who you are.

You've got this!

Connecting with Amelia and nurturing your relationship with her is a beautiful way to spend your time and energy today. Here are a few personalized ideas to consider:

1. **Read Together:**
   Pick out a book that you can read together. Whether it's continuing a story you've started or discovering a new adventure, this can be a special time for both of you.

2. **Roller Skating:**
   If Amelia enjoys roller skating, why not lace up your skates and join her? It's a fun activity that can help you both stay active and create joyful memories.

3. **Creative Project:**
   Engage in a creative project with Amelia. This could be arts and crafts, building a model, or even writing a short story together. The act of creating something can foster connection and pride in your joint accomplishment.

4. **Bike Ride Adventure:**
   Plan a bike ride to a destination she loves or explore a new area together. It's a perfect way to combine physical activity with quality time.

5. **Cook or Bake Together:**
   Involve Amelia in cooking dinner or baking a treat. This not only teaches valuable life skills but also provides an opportunity for conversation and teamwork.

6. **Teach a New Skill:**
   Share a skill with her that you're passionate about. Whether it's a magic trick, a new game, or even a bit of technology, teaching her something new can be incredibly rewarding.

7. **Homework Help:**
   If Amelia has any schoolwork or projects she's working on, offer to help her. Your involvement shows your interest in her education and provides a chance to encourage her love of learning.

8. **Nature Walk:**
   Take a walk in a park or nature reserve. Use this time to talk, observe the natural world, and perhaps discuss the importance of environmental stewardship.

9. **Meditate Together:**
   Introduce Amelia to meditation. A short, guided session can help her learn the value of mindfulness and could be a calming ritual for both of you.

10. **Plan a Future Activity:**
    Sit down with Amelia and plan a future outing or project. It could be as simple as a picnic in the park or a more elaborate plan for a daddy-daughter day out.

Choose an activity that resonates with both your interests and the kind of connection you wish to build with Amelia. It's not just about the activity itself, but the time spent together that will enrich both your lives.

What should I do with Amelia
